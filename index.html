            <h1>Solo Leveling season 2</h1>
            <p>Solo Leveling, also alternatively translated as Only I Level Up (Korean: 나 혼자만 레벨업; RR: Na Honjaman Rebeleop), is a South Korean portal fantasy[1] web novel written by Chugong. It was serialized in Kakao's digital comic and fiction platform

            </p>
            <p>A webtoon adaptation of Solo Leveling was first serialized in KakaoPage on March 4, 2018; it was illustrated by Jang Sung-rak (Dubu) and the webtoon's first season concluded on March 19, 2020, followed by its second season, which was released
                from August 2020 to December 2021.[3] The webtoon has been licensed in English by Yen Press. Its individual chapters have been collected and published in thirteen volumes by D&C Media, as of June 2024.[4]</p>
            <p>In a world where hunters — human warriors who possess supernatural abilities — must battle deadly monsters to protect mankind from certain annihilation, a notoriously weak hunter named Sung Jin-woo finds himself in a seemingly endless struggle
                for survival. One day, after narrowly surviving an overwhelmingly powerful double dungeon that nearly wipes out his entire party, a mysterious program called the System chooses him as its sole player and in turn, gives him the unique ability
                to level up in strength. This is something no other hunter is able to do, as a hunter's abilities are set once they awaken. Jinwoo then sets out on a journey as he fights against all kinds of enemies, both man and monster, to discover
                the secrets of the dungeons and the true source of his powers. He soon discovers that he has been chosen to inherit the position of Shadow Monarch, essentially turning him into an immortal necromancer who has absolute rule over the dead.
                He is the only Monarch who fights to save humanity, as the other Monarchs are all trying to kill him and wipe out the humans.</p>
            <p>Sung Jin-woo Voiced by: Taito Ban[6] (Japanese); Aleks Le[7] (English) Japanese name: Shun Mizushino (水篠 旬, Mizushino Shun) Sung Jin-woo (성진우; Seong Jinu) is the protagonist of the series. Originally a famously weak E-rank hunter, he gets
                the chance of a lifetime when he is selected as the Player of the System and is able to grow in strength without limit. Taking advantage of his new power, Jin-woo rises up to become the entire humanity's power, far stronger than the National
                Level Hunters. He eventually discovers the secret behind the System. Everything started from the never ending war between the Rulers and the Monarchs, two groups of extremely powerful humanoid beings created by a God. The previous Shadow
                Monarch, Ashborn, chooses and trains him through The System so he can be his successor.</p>
            <p>
                Cha Hae-In (차해인; Cha Haein) is a Korean S-Rank Hunter who specializes in swordsmanship and the only female S-Rank in the country. She has a rare condition that causes other hunters to smell foul to her. She eventually develops romantic feelings for Jinwoo
                after witnessing him in action and also because he is the only hunter she has ever met who actually smells nice to her. At the end, Jinwoo married her in the revised timeline, leading to the birth of their son, Suho. Sung Il-hwan Japanese
                name: Junichro Mizushino (水篠 ジュンイチロー, Mizushino Junichiro) Sung Il-Hwan (성일환; Seong Ilhwan) was a Korean S-Rank Hunter, Kyung-Hye's husband, and Jinwoo and Jinah's father. Ten years before the events of the main storyline, he suddenly
                disappeared inside a dungeon while on a raid, leaving his family to presume him dead. However, about a decade later, he returned to the human world to aid his son in the coming war against the Monarchs and was eventually revealed to be
                a Rulers' vessel, one of the seven humans chosen by the Rulers to serve them as their hosts. Although Il-Hwan ultimately succeeded in his mission, he ended up exerting far more power than his body could handle in his last battle with the
                Monarchs and consequently died afterwards in his son's arms, with Jinwoo unable to do anything to save him. Go Gun-hee Voiced by: Banjō Ginga[6] (Japanese); Kent Williams[7] (English) Japanese name: Kyoomi Gotou (後藤 清臣, Gotō Kyoomi) Go
                Gunhee (고건희; Gu Geonhui) was a Korean S-Rank Hunter and the Chairman of the Korean Hunters' Association, the government agency responsible for overseeing all the hunters, gates, and guilds active within Korea. Although he was later revealed
                to be a Rulers' vessel, he suffered from a variety of health problems due to his old age, preventing him from using his powers to their maximum output, and was ultimately killed by the Monarchs in battle.</p>
